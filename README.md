## Intro
This project was made to learn and train about React context and component.
It has three pages, login, register and a homepage. 
You will need to register to check the home page.
This project stores a token as you login, so when a token is saved and you try to access the login page,
you will be redirected to the home page, as long as the token is valid.

### Homepage
You can use this page to register all the technologies you know and current level of them.
You can click on the registered techs to modify the current level, but you can't change the name of the technology, 
if you want to change the name, please delete the current tech and create a new one with the correct name.

### Login / Register 
Uses react hook form to register a new user to the API and also to login.
Currently using Yup as resolver
